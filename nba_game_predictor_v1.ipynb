    "### Introduction and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As a math-minded person, I've always been interested in the use of numbers and analytics in sports. Being an avid follower of the NBA, I decided to pursue a project I've thought about for a while: **a machine learning model that could accurately predict the outcomes of NBA regular season games.** This project was my first real foray into data science, machine learning, and sports analytics, and was certainly one of the most instructive things I've ever worked on. The end result of this project is a high-accuracy ML model capable of intelligently predicting NBA games, and this notebook will step through the code and methods I used to create the model.\n"

    "### Setting Up\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict NBA game outcomes, we will need to analyze many past games and see what statistics help or hurt a team's chances of winning. We will also need a robust predictive model capable of making a decision based on all of this game data. For this project, I used `nba_api` to retrieve up-to-date NBA game data, `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation, and `scikit-learn` to build an ML model. All of the project's necessary imports will be included in the code block below."

    "\n",
    "We will base our model off of games played by all NBA teams. As shown, this game data will include categorical information about the game, teams, and season, quantitative data regarding one team's offensive and defensive statistics, and of course the winner of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will use the `nba_api` to get games played by each NBA team. Note that we set `season_type_nullable` to only include regular season games, since those are the types of games we aim to predict with this model. This could easily be changed to train a model better for predicting playoff or preseason games."

    "Our data is now workable and could already be used to create a decent model. However, a few new statistics will greatly improve our model's accuracy. First, we can indicate to our model if a team had home game advantage, which can have an immense impact on the away team. Additionally, we can indicate to the model the outcome of the team's last game, as a prior win or loss could affect the team's energy going into a future game. We can then calculate the important **\"Four Factors\"** in basketball, created by basketball statistician Dean Oliver. These statistics track a team's shooting, turnovers, rebounding, and free throws, and are arguably the best metrics for predicting team success in basketball. Finally, we can calculate a team's true shooting percentage in each game, another intelligent measure of shooting efficiency."

However, if we can use our model with **average** stats from teams this season, we can make individual predictions on games to be played in the future. To do this, we will need to know what games are going to be played. Once again, using `nba_api`, we can retrieve games played today with the `scoreboard` object."

Running the code below before noon would give predictions for the previous day's games."

    "Overall, I'm proud of how this project turned out. This project really sparked my interest in data science and machine learning, and I would definitely be happy to work in the field of AI/ML in the future. That being said, there are certainly a number of improvements that could be made. One limitation of the data from the `nba_api` was that I could not easily access game stats for the opposing team, potentially limiting the accuracy of my model. This could be fixed in the future by using a web scraper, which would theoretically allow me to retrieve any data I need related to each game played. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of my model is the fact that injuries are not accounted for, which can definitely make some predictions highly inaccurate. This could be fixed by making a model that instead analyzes data related to individual players rather than entire teams. That way, injured players could simply be ignored when comparing teams. In the future, I would like to recreate this project to address these limitations and make an even stronger model."
